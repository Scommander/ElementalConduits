## Introduction

"Elemental Conduits" is a survival friendly datapack designed for 1.16 (currently works in 1.17 too) which adds 4 new conduits into Minecraft! The fire conduit, earth conduit, ice conduit, and the air conduit. Each have their own unique abilities. This does require both a datapack AND resource pack so make sure you install both :)
